# MkPy:  Maunakea Python Workshop 2017

The Maunakea Python Workshop (MkPy) is scheduled for November 8-9, 2017 at the Subaru base facility in Hilo. 

The main MkPy workshop has the goal of bringing together programmers and scientists from all of the Maunakea Observatories.  The general structure will be two days, each with a half day of talks and a half day of "unconference sessions".

We will have keynote speakers and a series of talks given by attendees.  The goal is to foster collaboration between scientists and programmers and across organizations.

The afternoon sessions may include additional tutorials, lightning talks, discussion panels, and hack sessions.

## Talk Abstracts

__Keynote: Astropy and the Python in Astronomy Ecosystem__ (Erik Tollerud, Space Telescope Science Institute, member astropy project coordinators)

I will describe recent and coming developments in the Astropy Project.  I will describe the Astropy workflow and summarize key elements that have allowed it to be successful in bringing together scientists and developers from around the globe.  I will also outline major areas of current activity in the Astropy Project, particularly progress in the spectroscopy and photometry packages.  I will also discuss some of the new planned organizational changes for Astropy that we hope will help foster further collaboration and interoperability in the Python astronomy community as a whole.
