# MkPy Beginners Workshop

The beginners workshop will be a one day tutorial primarily intended for scientists who want to become proficient in Python programming.  Topics will include a basic intro to Python code, collaboration using git and GitHub, how to make plots in python using the matplotlib package, a basic introduction to the astronomy specific tools in astropy, and other topics to be determined.

The schedule and syllabus below are very tentative and may change before the class.
